My introverted nature.

"I am rarely bored alone; I am often bored in groups and crowds - laurie Helgoe.

I may be the guy next door suffering from wanderlust, the introvert or even the idiot. I may be the most boring person on this planet. I may also be a saint, a sinner, a muse, a nerd....anything...
I think you will understand me better when you've known me thru and thru...Believe me, very few people have had that privilege or curse as the case may be. If you've realized by now that I'm a pessimistic fool... 
Thank you! I'm a cynic as well....I don't always think the best about people or buy into the myth that humanity is inherently good.. And then, to turn around the opinion you've formed of me by now... 
let me proclaim I'm a dreamer, good listener, perceptive, down to earth, open-minded, knowledgeable, logical, quick learner, genuine, warm, generous, insightful, a secret keeper. kindly note that I ain't bragging...

I‚Äôm not one of the ‚Äúsmart people‚Äù and don‚Äôt ever want to be. Where I ever want to put myself it would be under the ‚ÄúGeek‚Äù label. When I say Geek, I mean that I‚Äôm a guy whose imaginations are endless, likes being
simple and humble with smiling face. I personally like listening to old people's stories, particularly when they start talking about scary stories. üëª I always see in movies and tv shows that when an elderly person 
tells a story people always roll their eyes and groan. Also in real life when my elderly teacher tells a story about when he was younger people always complain. I personally like old people‚Äôs stories. I find it interesting
to learn about life in the past. A lot of elderly people also have cool life stories. I know not everyone likes their stories but I think you should sometimes sit down and listen. It makes them feel less lonely, and you get to hear a cool story out of it. Most of the time I wear black or Dark grey polo shirt because I can‚Äôt match colours to save my life. THAT kind of Geek. I am a great lover of technology and science as well, who knows WAY too much about the world of fantasy, I can out quote absolutely anyone on Harry Potter, One piece, Naruto. While I may go on and on about my world of fantasy, I'd rather write a blog specific to this topic.I suppose that tells you enough and more about my beliefs and the type of person that I am. If you feel we have something common, then please go ahead and message me, I'd love to talk :)

I like creative stuff, like art, sewing, knitting, crocheting, also i play piano in my spare time. Above all I like cooking very much. I push doors that clearly say PULL. I walk into a room and forget why I was there, I count on my fingers in maths, I hide my pain from my best ones, I say its a long story when it is not. 

To be frank, I do not have a big friend network but only a few countable in fingers. Honestly, I am not good for friendship, no mistakes from their side but my side because I cannot put effort into maintaining too big friends circles. It is wrong to say but the truth is, I have other priorities than impressing others.
          
"I believe that everything happens to me for a reason. People change so that I can learn to let go, things go wrong so that I appreciate them when I'm right, I believe lies so I eventually learn to trust no one but myself,and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together." ‚Äï Marilyn Monroe. I am always cautious about what I wish for, and at the same time, I'm so thankful for what I have. To be honest, I'm not liking the idea of staying till my 60s or 70s. But who knows what tomorrow holds, as long as there's a tomorrow, let's focus on learning new stuff each day. 
            
So, Why this blog and where do we go from now? Well, I've always wanted to start a blog, I was just super lazy. This blog is a colletion of my findings, tutorials and stuff I find rather interesting.
