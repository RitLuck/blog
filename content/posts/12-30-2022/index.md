It's been one year since I deleted my Facebook account because in the past three years, I barely used it. I used to like Facebook because it delivered on its original mission:

Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.

They’re clearly no longer true to that mission. When I joined in 2010, the news feed chronologically listed status updates from your friends. Great!

Since then, they’ve done every imaginable thing to increase time spent, also known as the euphemistic “engagement”. They’ve done this by surfacing friends’ likes, suggested likes, friends’ replies, suggested friends, suggested pages to like based on prior likes, and of course: ads. Those things are not only distractions, they’re actively annoying.

Instead of minimizing time spent so users can get back to their lives, Facebook has sacrificed users at the altar of advertising: more time spent = more ads shown.

An entire spectrum of concerns to choose from, along two axes: privacy and walled garden. And of course, the interesting intersection of minimized privacy and maximized walled gardenness: the filter bubble.

Long story short: Facebook is not for me anymore. It’s okay to not know everything that’s been going on. It makes for more interesting conversations when you do get to see each other again. 

The older I get, the more I prefer the one communication medium that is not a walled garden, that I can control, back up and search: e-mail.
