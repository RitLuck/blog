Now that 2022 is almost over, I decided to write about my experience so far in general. Guessing this post will be a bit longer since it will contain a lot of pictures.

Electric with computer Science, yes it was an actual course at UOM(university of Mauritius), that was the course i took during my time at unviersity. I really didn’t enjoy my university life as much as I should have. I felt like during my entire 20s I was just trailing along, not really enjoying life, always resentful and regretful of my choices, and just wasting my time altogether. I didn’t even go on many holidays or trips anywhere. Most of my time was spent trying to rectify something that didn’t need to be. But I made some really good friends(which I hope they'll be lifelong friends).

Here a bunch of pictures I took during my three years at unviersity. (coming soon...)
