There's really no way to explain to my friends why I use Linux without boring them, but I've had most success piquing their interest by simply boiling it down to the fact that, well, it's fun.

I love Linux also because of the freedom it gives you, and it's package manager. I like to 'own' my machine and if it doesn't work exactly the way I want it to, I want to be able to change that. I love to fiddle with stuff and on Linux I can do that. Linux just does what I tell it to do. No waiting. No hidden bullshit. No questions asked. It just works and I feel at home.

GNU/Linux is open source which means that if you want you can look at the code to check if somebody is spying on you. Yeah I’m looking at you Microsoft. You can also if you have experience in programming try and help in development of the Linux kernel or software. It is much more secure than windows because updates are coming faster and the code is always changing. It is also because GNU/Linux doesn’t have that much usage still but that will probably change soon, maybe even sooner that we think.
