Do I use linux beacause of its free and customizable? or perphaps because of its security?

While all that is true, it's also just marketing bullshit to get the attention of non-linux users because they wouldn’t understand the real reason.

I use Linux because it’s fun! and also of the freedom it gives you. I like to 'own' my machine and if it doesn't work exactly the way I want it to, I want to be able to change that. Linux just does what I tell it to do. No waiting. No hidden bullshit. No questions asked. It just works and I feel at home.
