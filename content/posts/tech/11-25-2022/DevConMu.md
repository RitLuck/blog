Mauritius Developers Conference 2022

This week, more than 900 tech enthusiast descended on the city of Port Louis at [Caudan Arts Centre](https://caudanartscentre.com/)for the 7th Developers Conference. In case you are wondering what is the Developers Conference. Here is a beautful article written by [Ish Sookun](https://twitter.com/IshSookun) on L'express [DEVCON](https://lexpress.mu/node/415580). 

Before we start talking about devcon, lets take a moment to appreciate the venue first. It was my first time being there for an event, and damn its beautiful. Unfortunately I did not take many photos but here is [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/AfriTheatreMag/status/1484796561884340225) I found. I can say I think it is absolutely remarkable.
